# Electricity Demand Forecasting with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Time series techniques to forecast electricity demand based on historical consumption data and other relevant features. The notebook guides the user through data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization of results.

Dataset:Electricity consumption UK 2009-2024

### Features

- **Data Upload & Loading**: Users can load historical electricity demand datasets.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data for forecasting.
- **Model Training**: Implements forecasting using XGBoost and LSTM.
- **Forecast Visualization**: Generates plots comparing predicted vs. actual demand.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays evaluation metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and R² score.
- **Flexible Analysis**: Users can adjust model parameters and forecast horizons.

## Requirements
